Dear Stephanie,

From the moment we started talking, I knew there was something special about you.  
Your smile, your laugh, your energy — they light up every part of my world.  
You are the warmth in my cold days, the calm in my chaos, and the heartbeat in my silence.

I made this little web page not because I’m a developer,  
but because I’m hopelessly in love with you.  
Every line of code, every floating heart, every animation...  
was crafted with one purpose — to make you smile.

I hope this love letter reminds you  
that you are **cherished**, **adored**, and **loved beyond measure**.

Forever yours,  
**❤️ [Your Name]**
